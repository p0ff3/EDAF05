\subsection{Description}
Find paths between given words among the five-letter words of English.

\subsection{How words connect}

We define a directed graph of words as follows.
There is one node for every 5-letter word.
There is an arc from $v$ to $w$ if each of the last four letters of $v$ appears in $w$.
For example, there is an arc from \emph{yodel} to \emph{lodes}, but not from \emph{lodes} to \emph{yodel} because the latter contains no S. 
On the other hand, there is an arc from \emph{sharp} to \emph{graph} and back. 
All four letters have to appear with repetitions, so there is an arc from \emph{where} to \emph{ether} (both Es appear) but not to \emph{retch} (E appears only once).
As an example, here’s a pretty long path in the graph:

\subsection{Requirements}

You build a directed graph representing the adjacency structure of the words in the list called {\tt words-5757.txt}, and run BFS on it. 
The input to your algorithm is two words, like {\tt climb} and {\tt hames}.
Your algorithm returns the words on a shortest path from the first word to the second.

The data directory contains a number of test inputs with known distances, your algorithm must work correctly on those.\sidenote{There can be many shortest paths, so it makes no sense to specify the words on the path.}

If you can, make the running time of your algorithm  $O(n+m)$, where $n$ and $m$ refer to the number of nodes and arcs in the underlying directed graph. 
In particular, you’re not supposed to use quadratic time in $n$ to build the graph, even though it’s tempting.\sidenote{Of course, for dense graphs, $O(n+m)$ would be quadratic time anyway.
But the input graph is not dense.}

\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The source code for your implementation
  \item A report in PDF.
  Use the report skeleton in the {\tt doc directory}.
  \end{enumerate}
